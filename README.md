## Usage

TODO

## Demo

A live demo is available [here](http://gravnic.chrispole.com). Level saving/solving might not work as using the free Heroku plan which means the services will take about 30 seconds to "wake up". Open the failed network requests in a seperate tab if you want to see these working.

## Roadmap

* Implement the remaining gameplay elements
* Replace the placeholder graphics with the live ones
* Finish writing the documentation
* Have the level solver able to solve problems concurrently
* Optimisations the performance of the level solver
* Add missing tests

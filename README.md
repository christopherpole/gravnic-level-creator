A React/Redux web app that lets you create, manage, preview and automatically solve "Gravnic" levels.

## TODO

* Use the Web Animation API to animate the level preview entities instead of CSS animations & sagas in order to simplify and improve the performance of the level preview tool
* Performance optimisations to the level solver
* Have the level solver find all possible solutions for a level instead of just finding the quickest solution each time
* Add missing tests
* Write some (proper) documentation on usage
